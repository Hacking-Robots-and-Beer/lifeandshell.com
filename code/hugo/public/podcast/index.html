We as practitioners have so many things to consider and do that, in most cases, we do not have enough cognitive capacity left when looking into our library sources.

        We are excited about the new breed of tools coming to the market. We often had to put together tools to find out what was in production and what broke it. Your monitoring tools go as far as only telling you that something isn&rsquo;t working as expected but not why it is so, and then you have to scramble to figure out what versions of services are in production, were there any recent deploys, etc. So you can understand what has changed to narrow down possible causes. Our good friend Mike and his team are building the tool to answer exactly such questions, so we thought you might be interested in hearing him out.

        Communication in co-located teams is quite often complicated. It is even more complex and, at the same time, important in distributed teams. Have you ever got an issue report that says this thing is failing? No logs, no explanation of context, no nothing. Pretty sure we&rsquo;ve all been in such situations. How do you step up your communication game? This episode of DevSecOps Talks is about great communication tips for DevSecOps practitioners in distributed (and not only) teams.

        We have had Git around for more than 15 years, and during that time, it has become a standard de-facto to share code and track code changes. While Git is a superior version control system to most of what we have seen before, it has been 15 years since the first release. Should we be looking for new ways to approach version control systems? Is the time right for the next generation of tools in this area?

Today, there are tools available to package, distribute, and run them locally as well as in the public cloud. While talking to Ian, it felt that the state of the technology is very similar to Linux containers at the beginning of 2010x, just before Docker made Linux containers available for everyone.

      <code>
        The real cloud lock-in is security! Every service/cloud provider has its own levels of granularity regarding resources. Cloud engineering is mainly about compute, storage, and networking and how to make them scale. Scaling security is often left out as it is hard to measure on so many levels.
We think that it is a myth and that we can measure how many steps it takes to add, modify or remove access rights. It all starts with monitoring, knowing what is there in a cloud infrastructure is a very good first step. By making it easy to see and manage access rights, we make it easier for ourselves to keep resources secured.

        This is the first episode in the new format - 30 minutes short and crisp episodes, i.e., less water and side discussions, focusing on the topic, duration under (well, almost under) 30 minutes. We hope you like it!
 
The topic of this episode is building docker images - automation, security, best practices.
 
In this episode, we discuss:
Saving money with T3a family
Building Docker images locally and in CI
Setting up deamonless Docker builds for CI and k8s
Using multistage builds to keep your images nice and clean as well as encapsulate the build environment and make it portable
Passing secrets to Docker build and inspecting image layers for secrets (ssh-agent and many more)
Keeping Docker images updated with dependencies and updates
Scanning Docker images for vulnerabilities
Docker image layers caching - doing it right
DockerHub is to delete old images stored for free, and GitHub is ready to host them for you
Docker image naming so you can find all you need to debug quickly
