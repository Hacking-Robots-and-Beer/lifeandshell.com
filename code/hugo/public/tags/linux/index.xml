      <description>If you&amp;#8217;re running Wazuh in an environment with compliance requirements like PCI DSS, SOC 2, or HIPAA, you know that multi-factor authentication (MFA) and strict access control are non-negotiable. The need to prove who has access to sensitive security logs—and who can modify configurations—means that shared accounts and simple passwords are no longer enough.&#xA;It&amp;#8217;s time to connect Wazuh to a modern authentication provider. This guide will walk you through integrating Wazuh with Keycloak, a powerful open-source Identity and Access Management (IAM) solution.</description>

      <description>How I Built a Custom Wazuh Log Ingest Pipeline (And Ditched the Wodle) If you&amp;#8217;ve ever tried to push custom logs into Wazuh, you’ve probably stumbled across something called a Wodle. Wazuh uses these built-in scripts to collect and parse data—especially useful for integrations like AWS.&#xA;So… Wodle for AWS? Sure, Wodle can collect AWS logs. But when I tried using it for my AWS environment, things didn’t exactly go as planned.</description>

      <title>Running Wazuh Agents in Docker – From Traditional HIDS to Ingest Agents</title>

      <description>Wazuh Wazuh is a powerful open-source security platform built to monitor systems for threats, intrusions, and anomalies. Traditionally, the Wazuh agent is installed on physical or virtual Linux servers to perform host-based intrusion detection (HIDS). It passively monitors the system and reports any suspicious changes or activity to the Wazuh manager.&#xA;This works well in environments where systems are treated as immutable infrastructure — where servers are expected to remain unchanged.</description>

      <description>From OSSEC to Wazuh: My Journey and Kubernetes Setup I started a long time ago using OSSEC, and eventually transitioned over to Wazuh—back when it still relied on Elasticsearch for storage and search. Recently, when I returned to Wazuh for a new project, I was surprised to find that there was no simple way to deploy Wazuh into a local Kubernetes cluster for testing. So, I decided to revive and modernize an old Helm chart I had built a while back.</description>

      <description>For some IoT setups a need a k3s cluster running. To make it spread and to add more nodes a installed the k3s Master on my firewall running a small atom processor. But wanted to run the nodes on raspberry or rock nodes to handle the load.&#xA;Then by using labels on nodes I want to apply different workloads on the nodes.&#xA;Pre So before installing k3s master. I had my pihole running on port 80 and that did not work that well.</description>

      <description>I have some openvas scanners running but to use the scanners a need the results as json files. Then i can use my ELK stack to visualize and have dashboards over the results from the scan.&#xA;Before I used vulwisperer to export the result from openvas and to get them into elk. But from the latest release of openvas the support from vulwipspere is gone.&#xA;So i have created my own pyton script that reads the results from openvas scannings.</description>

      <description>Vulwisperer is a tool to read the finding from a openvas scanner and to send them to a other tools. Here i want them to be sent to a elasticsearch and kibana. To do this i first need to start a openvas scan and get some results. &amp;#8211;Then use vulwisperer to get the results from openvas and store the results in json files.From the json files a then uses logstash to send the finding to elastic.</description>

      <description>So running sql in docker is a big qestion now. To make some test i have setup two mariadb cluster docker containers. The first one is the mariadb cluster master. This will setup a master mariadb sql node running.&#xA;The second one is the MariaDB cluster slave. This docker will connect to the master and rsync the database over to the slave. Then en database is rsynced over it will start the sql and can process sql data.</description>

      <description>So spent last evning blocking ip comming from packetflip to our server. Looks in our Apache access log that there was some evil scraping going on so we started blocking. But its not that funny to block many ip manually so time for some scripts.&#xA;&amp;nbsp;&#xA;First some info to use Packetflip user agent was&#xA;Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.</description>

      <description>So i HATE spam and now to get rid of as so many as possible i go for 3 step.&#xA;1. Postfix Get postfix to restrict witch is to allow to send email to me.&#xA;No strange name and use spam block lists. Also restrict time in how many connections you can do.&#xA;2. Greylisting&#xA;So the first time some server tries to send email greylist says no resend that email.</description>

      <description>So now I have en working Postfix that receive email i need something so that I can read me emails.&#xA;So we will setup dovecot to use our mysql for users. and use SSL on all our connections.&#xA;&amp;nbsp;&#xA;Setup Mysql Create a file called dovecot-sql.conf.ext in /etc/dovecot (Ore where you want to have it)&#xA;Add the following settings to the config file&#xA;driver = mysql&#xD;connect = host=localhost dbname=virtual_mail user=postfix password=some_pass&#xD;default_pass_scheme = MD5-CRYPT&#xD;user_query = SELECT &#39;/home/vmail/%n@%d/&#39; as home, 5000 AS uid, 5000 AS gid FROM mailbox WHERE username = &#39;%u&#39;&#xD;password_query = SELECT password FROM mailbox WHERE username = &#39;%u&#39; Update so it match you config.</description>

      <description>So for my virtual machines I have set up an mail system with Postfix that will look up users and domain in a Mysql server. Then store the emails in one mailbox.&#xA;For users to get there mail it uses Dovecot IMAP and Squrrelmail for displaying email.&#xA;This setup can be deployed all on one machine as I do. Or If you have allot of mail u can use cluster function for postfix.</description>

      <description>So you have updated the kernel on you centos but you server is still running on the old kernel. Whenan kernel is updated yum updates the file /etc/grub.conf and that is an synlink to /boot/grub/grub.conf but if the link is broken then you will have two grub.conf. One /etc/grub.conf and one /boot/grub/grub.conf and then when you update en kernel the server will still not run on the new kernel.&#xA;&amp;nbsp;</description>

      <description>Im using nagios as primary monitoring tool. And to get alerts we use an sms gateway. The problem is that sometimes when we work we bring down and server and we get so many sms from icinga that you trow away you phone. So for bringing the sms cost down and to have not so many sms to you phone i build a small email blocking script. This will take the address of the sms and only send one sms / email every 5 min (can be set to anything).</description>
