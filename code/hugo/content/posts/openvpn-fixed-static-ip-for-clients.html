<p>When my cloud server connect to my openvpn server i need them to have the same ip addres. All the time this is so I can set up monitoring and alerts system. Internal DNS and puppet controll.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the openvpn server ad this in you server.conf</p>
<pre>client-config-dir /etc/openvpn/ccd</pre>
<p>then create the folder /etc/openvpn/ccd</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In that folder create an file and give it the file name as you user ore keys are called.<br />
Im using only keys and if i created an key with named web1-tx (I use my openvpn client create script see other post)</p>
<p>Then I create the file web-tx in the ccd folder.<br />
Put the ip you want the server to have in that file.</p>
<pre>ifconfig-push 10.20.0.12</pre>
<p>Restart you openvpn server and you are done.</p>
