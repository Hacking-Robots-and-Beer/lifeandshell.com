<h2>The Foundation of Your Web Application</h2>
<p>Every website and web application needs a web server to deliver content to visitors. The &#8216;Ubuntu System Administration Guide&#8217; kicks off by introducing the two most popular open-source web servers: Apache and Nginx. Both are powerful, but they have different strengths and configuration styles.</p>
<h3>Apache: The Veteran</h3>
<p>Apache has been a dominant force on the web for decades. It&#8217;s known for its flexibility, powerful module system, and `.htaccess` file support for directory-level configuration. The book guides you through installing it with a simple `apt install apache2` and explains its modular configuration structure, with sites being enabled by linking from `sites-available` to `sites-enabled`.</p>
<h3>Nginx: The Challenger</h3>
<p>Nginx is renowned for its high performance, especially when handling a large number of concurrent connections, and its efficiency as a reverse proxy and load balancer. The book shows how to install Nginx and highlights its similar, yet distinct, configuration structure, demonstrating how to point it to your web application&#8217;s root directory.</p>
