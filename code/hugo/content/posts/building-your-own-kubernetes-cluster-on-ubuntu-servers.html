<h2>Take Control of Your Container Orchestration</h2>
<p>While cloud providers offer managed Kubernetes services, building your own cluster provides a deeper understanding and ultimate control. The &#8216;Ubuntu System Administration Guide&#8217; provides a detailed, hands-on guide to creating a production-ready Kubernetes cluster from scratch on a set of Ubuntu servers using the official `kubeadm` tool.</p>
<h3>The Master and Worker Node Architecture</h3>
<p>A Kubernetes cluster consists of at least one &#8216;master&#8217; (or control-plane) node and one or more &#8216;worker&#8217; nodes. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Master Node:</strong> This is the brain of the cluster. It runs the Kubernetes API server, scheduler, and controller manager, which are responsible for managing the state of the cluster.</li>
<li><strong>Worker Nodes:</strong> These are the machines where your actual applications (as containers in Pods) run. The master node tells the worker nodes what to run, and the workers execute the instructions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The book guides you through preparing your Ubuntu servers, installing the necessary dependencies like a container runtime (CRI-O), and then initializing the cluster.</p>
