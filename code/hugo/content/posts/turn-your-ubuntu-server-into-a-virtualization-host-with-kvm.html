<h2>Unlock the Power of Multiple Servers on One Machine</h2>
<p>Virtualization is a cornerstone of modern IT, and the &#8216;Ubuntu System Administration Guide&#8217; shows you how to transform a standard Ubuntu server into a powerful host for running multiple virtual machines (VMs). The guide focuses on KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine), the native virtualization solution for Linux.</p>
<h3>Why Host VMs on Your Server?</h3>
<p>Running VMs allows you to isolate services, test new software in a safe environment, and make efficient use of your hardware. Instead of needing a separate physical machine for every service, you can run them all on a single, powerful server, each within its own secure and independent virtual environment.</p>
<h3>Getting Started with KVM</h3>
<p>The first step is to ensure your server&#8217;s CPU has virtualization support enabled in the BIOS. The book then guides you through installing all the necessary KVM packages with a single `apt` command. Once installed, you can verify that KVM acceleration is available with the `kvm-ok` command, confirming your server is ready to host VMs.</p>
