<p>I hope that you have already test my nmap scanners for kubernetes. Now its time for some more OWASP and webb scanner.<br>Nikto is a webb application scanners and run against a target to verify its security.</p>



<p>I have created a nikto docker and a helm job that deploys the nikto scanner into your kubernetes cluster.<br>The nikto scanner will then on regular basic scan you webbapps for security issues. Any finding will be logged as a json log ready for your log pipeline to pick up and visualize.</p>



<p>docker run -it -e TARGET=samma.io sammascanner/nikto</p>
