<p>So efter I had publish mw post i got some mysql error.<br />
The checksum did was not correct. So for solving this i had to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Control the checksum ibdata is you innodb data file</p>
<pre>innochecksum ibdata1 -d</pre>
<p>So i have not all writen to database.<br />
so lets write then with force</p>
<pre>mysqld_safe  --innodb_force_recovery 4</pre>
<p>Then when it done kill the mysql and restart it normaly and you data mysql should be up and running again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And now you data should be in sync and you mysql run again.</p>
