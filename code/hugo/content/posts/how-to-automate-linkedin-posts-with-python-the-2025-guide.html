<p></p>



<p>I have a simple workflow: I write my posts in WordPress, and once they&#8217;re ready, a workflow kicks off to get them published. A key part of this process is announcing the new post on LinkedIn to let my network know it&#8217;s live.</p>



<p>Sounds easy, right? Well, I quickly discovered that most Python libraries for the LinkedIn API are outdated. LinkedIn has deprecated large parts of its old API, leaving many tools broken.</p>



<p>After a bit of digging, I found a solid solution using just Python and the <code>requests</code> library. With this method, I can successfully post to my personal profile and into groups I manage. While I couldn&#8217;t get it to work for a company page, this covers most of my needs. Here&#8217;s how you can do it too.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Step 1: Getting the Bloody Access Token</h2>



<p>Before we can do anything, we need an <strong>access token</strong>. Be warned, this is the most painful part of the process.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Create a LinkedIn App</h3>



<p>First, you need to head over to the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.linkedin.com/developers/">LinkedIn Developer Portal</a> and create an app. Fill out all the necessary details, give it a logo, and make sure you verify it if needed.</p>



<p>Inside your app settings, you&#8217;ll find your <strong>Client ID</strong> and <strong>Client Secret</strong>. You&#8217;ll also need to add a <strong>Redirect URI</strong>. For this guide, we&#8217;ll use a dummy URL: <code>https://localhost:3000/callback</code>. Just make sure the URL you add here is the <em>exact same one</em> you use in the next step.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Authorize Your App</h3>



<p>Now, you need to grant your newly created app permission to access your LinkedIn account. To do this, construct the following URL, replacing <code>YOUR_CLIENT_ID</code> with your app&#8217;s Client ID.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>https:&#47;&#47;www.linkedin.com/oauth/v2/authorization?response_type=code&amp;client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&amp;redirect_uri=https://localhost:3000/callback&amp;state=foobar&amp;scope=openid,profile,w_member_social,w_organization_social
</code></pre>



<p>Paste this URL into your browser. You&#8217;ll be asked to log in to LinkedIn and authorize the app. After you approve it, you&#8217;ll be redirected to the dummy URL we set up. Since <code>localhost:3000</code> isn&#8217;t running anything, you&#8217;ll see an error page. <strong>This is expected!</strong></p>



<p>Look at the URL in your browser&#8217;s address bar. It will look something like this:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
https://localhost:3000/callback?code=Axxxxxxxxxxxxx&#8230;..&#038;state=foobar
</div></figure>



<p>See that long string of characters after <code>code=</code>? That&#8217;s your <strong>authorization code</strong>. Copy it!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Exchange the Code for an Access Token</h3>



<p>Now we trade that code for our final access token. Open your terminal and use the following <code>cURL</code> command. Replace the placeholders with your <strong>Client ID</strong>, <strong>Client Secret</strong>, and the <strong>authorization code</strong> you just copied.</p>



<p>Bash</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>curl --location --request POST 'https://www.linkedin.com/oauth/v2/accessToken' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--data-urlencode 'grant_type=authorization_code' \
--data-urlencode 'code=PASTE_YOUR_AUTHORIZATION_CODE_HERE' \
--data-urlencode 'client_id=PASTE_YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE' \
--data-urlencode 'client_secret=PASTE_YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE' \
--data-urlencode 'redirect_uri=https://localhost:3000/callback'
</code></pre>



<p>When you run this, the response will be a JSON object containing your <code>access_token</code>. Save it securely—this is the key to making API calls. </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Step 2: Finding Your User and Group IDs</h2>



<p>To post, you need to know <em>who</em> is posting and <em>where</em> they are posting. In the LinkedIn API, these are identified by URNs (Uniform Resource Names).</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Get Your Personal URN</h3>



<p>You can find your personal URN by making a simple API call. Run the following Python script, making sure to add your new access token.</p>



<p>Python</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>import requests

# Paste the access token you received
ACCESS_TOKEN = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE"

headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}"
}

api_url = "https://api.linkedin.com/v2/userinfo"

try:
    response = requests.get(api_url, headers=headers)
    response.raise_for_status()
    user_info = response.json()
    print(f"Success! Your URN is: {user_info&#91;'sub']}")
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
</code></pre>



<p>The output will contain your URN in the <code>sub</code> field. It will look like <code>urn:li:person:xxxxxxxx</code>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Get a Group URN</h3>



<p>To find a group&#8217;s ID, navigate to the group on LinkedIn and click to manage or edit it. The group ID is the number in the URL. Your Group URN will be <code>urn:li:group:GROUP_ID</code>.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Step 3: Let&#8217;s Post to LinkedIn!</h2>



<p>With the access token and URNs in hand, we can finally post. The script below sends a simple text post.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Set the <code>ACCESS_TOKEN</code>.</li>



<li>Set the <code>author</code> to your personal URN.</li>



<li>To post to a <strong>group</strong>, set the <code>containerEntity</code> to the group&#8217;s URN. To post to your <strong>personal profile</strong>, comment out or remove the <code>"containerEntity"</code> line entirely.</li>



<li>Change the <code>text</code> inside <code>shareCommentary</code> to whatever you want to post.</li>
</ul>



<p>Python</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>import requests
import json

# Your access token
ACCESS_TOKEN = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE"
# Your personal URN (from the previous step)
YOUR_PERSON_URN = "urn:li:person:xxxxxxxx"
# The URN of the group you want to post to
GROUP_URN = "urn:li:group:1234567"

def post_to_linkedin(post_text):
    """Posts a message to a LinkedIn group or personal profile."""

    api_url = "https://api.linkedin.com/v2/ugcPosts"
    
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "X-Restli-Protocol-Version": "2.0.0"
    }

    post_data = {
        "author": YOUR_PERSON_URN,
        "lifecycleState": "PUBLISHED",
        # To post to a group, include the line below.
        # To post to your personal feed, remove it.
        "containerEntity": GROUP_URN,
        "specificContent": {
            "com.linkedin.ugc.ShareContent": {
                "shareCommentary": {
                    "text": post_text
                },
                "shareMediaCategory": "NONE"
            }
        },
        "visibility": {
            "com.linkedin.ugc.MemberNetworkVisibility": "PUBLIC"
        }
    }

    try:
        response = requests.post(api_url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(post_data))
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for bad status codes
        print("Post successful! ")
        print(response.json())
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        if e.response:
            print(f"Response status code: {e.response.status_code}")
            print(f"Response content: {e.response.text}")

# Example usage:
my_new_blog_post_announcement = "I just published a new blog post about automating LinkedIn with Python! Check it out. #python #automation #linkedinapi"
post_to_linkedin(my_new_blog_post_announcement)

</code></pre>



<p>And that&#8217;s it! While the initial setup with OAuth 2.0 is a bit of a marathon, once you have the token, automating your posts from any Python script is straightforward. Happy automating! </p>
