<p>I have now starting to move all my hosting and code to the Google cloud platform.<br />
But when i developing new things i want to use the power and flexibility that the platform gives me but i want to develop local.</p>
<p>So for my new project with using Datastore and the python app engine. I have set up a docker-compose for me.<br />
Now i can spin up my compose and build my app and then when don deploy to the cloud platform.</p>
