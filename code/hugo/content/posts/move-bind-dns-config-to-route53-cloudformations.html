<p>I have started migrate our bind server into AWS and Route53. We have all our config as code so to migrate over our DNS I needed to convert our bind Zone files into Route53 Cloudformations.</p>



<p>I found that one of our ZONE files was big so i wrote a small Python script in docker that converts zone files into route53 Cloudformations.</p>



<p>After the convert is done a did some manual check to verify i looks good and add any TXT record.</p>

<p>Here is a git repo with docker and docker-compose that will run and convert bind ZONE files into Route53 Cloudformations</p>
