<p>So my first week has gone since i rooted my Nexus 4 and installed the new Ubuntu phone.</p>
<p>It was realy easy to root and install the phone the hole process was done in 30 min including backup.<br />
It has bean I hard week but now at the end life with the phone is better.</p>
<p>So the ONLY things that really work in the phone is.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make and receives calls</li>
<li>Send and receives SMS</li>
<li>With i browser surf (Only from wifi )</li>
</ul>
<p>That about it so my connections to the world when Im on the road is dead. No more facebook, Instagram and so on.<br />
I use the browser to look things up if i had to.(This require a start my 4gwifi device)</p>
<p>But now I got to like the interface and thing that thiscan be good.</p>
<p>And it nice when you can connect your phone to the laptop and open an shell into the phone.(Used to sync my gmail contacts to the phone)</p>
<p>There are still some things that are not 100% god you can say some bugs. But its a develop phone now and im now downloading the develop toolkit :-).<br />
So we will see how hard it s to build your own app to the Ubunut phone.</p>
