<p>to get some performance data from my server i use Munin monitroing system.<br />
And here is i samm guide how to install and set up munin on the munin serer and on the munin client.</p>
<p>First up is to setup the munin server</p>
<pre>yum install munin munin-node &lt;-- on server

yum install munin-node &lt;-- on clients</pre>
<p>i install both the munin server and node on the same host so i can monitor the host that the munin server is on.</p>
<p>Now when the package is install lets add some host to monitor on the server.<br />
Here is my conf for my server. As you se my admin.elinodrift.se has the munin server on the same server. so then i use localhost</p>
<pre>[admin.elinodrift.se]
 address 127.0.0.1
 use_node_name yes</pre>
<pre>[eu1.elinodrift.se]
 address 10.8.0.2
 use_node_name yes</pre>
<p>So now my munin server is ready time for setting up the munin node.<br />
Open the file <strong>/etc/munin/munin-node.conf</strong> in this file there are two importent things.</p>
<p><strong>host_name admin.elinodrift.se</strong>  &lt;&#8212; set this to same name you gave the client on the munin server</p>
<p><strong>allow ^127\.0\.0\.1$</strong> &lt;&#8212; Add your munin server ip here so its allow to connect</p>
<p>Save and restart you munin klient</p>
<pre>/etc/init.d/munin-node restart</pre>
<p>test from you munin server to run</p>
<pre>telnet ip to munin client 4949</pre>
<p>and you should se so that the munin server can connect to the munin client.</p>
<p>So now we have a working conenctio between the munin server and the munin nodes.<br />
So lets get some service to monitor.</p>
<pre>cd /etc/munin/plugins/</pre>
<p>In this folder you add the plugins you want to monitor. So for adding new plugins link in new plugins.</p>
<pre>ln -s /usr/share/munin/plugins/name of plugin .</pre>
<p>When you have added the plugins you want. Its time to test so that the plugins works. Run the node plugin test to verify</p>
<pre>munin-node-configure</pre>
<p>If you plugins need config look in the folder /etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/<br />
After you added the plugin you want you can restart the muni-node and wait for the stats to update.</p>
