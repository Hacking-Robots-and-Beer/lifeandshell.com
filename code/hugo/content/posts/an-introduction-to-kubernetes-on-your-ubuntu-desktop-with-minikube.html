<h2>Orchestrate Your Containers Like the Pros</h2>
<p>When you move from running a few containers to managing a complex, scalable application, you need an orchestration platform. Kubernetes is the industry standard, and the &#8216;Ubuntu System Administration Guide&#8217; shows you how to get started with it on your local machine using a tool called Minikube.</p>
<h3>What is Kubernetes?</h3>
<p>Kubernetes (often called K8s) automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It groups containers into logical units called &#8216;Pods&#8217; and handles networking, storage, and load balancing, ensuring your application is resilient and available.</p>
<h3>Setting Up a Local Cluster</h3>
<p>Minikube is a lightweight tool that lets you run a single-node Kubernetes cluster inside a container or VM on your Ubuntu desktop. The book guides you through installing Minikube and `kubectl`, the command-line tool used to interact with your cluster. With a simple `minikube start` command, you&#8217;ll have a local Kubernetes environment ready for deploying your applications.</p>
