<p>So I have testet so many differnt webbbased email programs. And have not been 100% happy with any of them. some are to big other look really bad.</p>
<p>(Rainloop is open for non profit companies 🙂 )</p>
<p>But now i found one that I hope i can like some boor Rainloop http://rainloop.net/<br />
It looks nice and are realy easy to install and setup.</p>
<p>Here is how I installe if for my domain.</p>
<p>First gp to the directory where you want the rainloop folder</p>
<p>cd /var/www/html<br />
mkdir webmail<br />
cd webmail</p>
<p>Get the code and deps it will install in the folder you are in! (Youd dont get a folder raindloop with the stuff)</p>
<p>curl -s http://repository.rainloop.net/installer.php | php</p>
<p>So now you have it setup surf into you folder mine is on</p>
<p>https://domain/webmail/</p>
<p>You should now see the login page</p>
<p>Go to the admin page witch is on this url</p>
<p>https://domain/webmail/?admin</p>
<p>login with user <strong>admin</strong> password <strong>12345</strong></p>
<p>First change you admin password</p>
<p>Add you domain to the domain list. And i deleted the other domains.<br />
Setup the settings to you own imap and smtp server.</p>
<p>Set uner general you domain to the default so you dont have to add @domain when you login.</p>
<p>Enable contact in the Contacts tab</p>
<p>So all done now start using an webmail service that looks good.</p>
