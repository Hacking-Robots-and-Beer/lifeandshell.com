<p>So at work we have started to look at OAuth2 for our web apps. So on our creativ friday today i started looking at putting together an OAuth2 server using python and flask.</p>
<p>I followed the guide from this page <a title="http://lepture.com/en/2013/create-oauth-server" href="http://lepture.com/en/2013/create-oauth-server" target="_blank">http://lepture.com/en/2013/create-oauth-server</a></p>
<p>And after some work I got an working server and client running on my Centos server.</p>
<p>The code only uses an sqlite db and are only testing the OAuth functions so for a working solutions there are some more work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All info how get the server and client and code are located here on my github</p>
