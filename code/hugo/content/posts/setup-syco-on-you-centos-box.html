 Install all commands defined in install.cfg for host localhost.localdomain.
 Error: No commands for this host.</pre>
<p>As you see I have NOT define any commands for my host so lets do that</p>
<h2>2. Setup syco to to its magic</h2>
<p>Open the file /opt/syco/etc/install.cfg this file set you settings for system.<br />
And you should have this file in a secret locations 🙂</p>
<p>So for this test I will set up my virtual test box I added this to the end of my file se below with comments on what it does.</p>
<pre>[localhost.localdomain.]
desc:My localhost virtual host
type: host
command01: syco iptables-setup
command02: syco hardening
command03: syco install-ntp-client
command04: syco install-mail-relay-client
#command05: syco install-clam
#command20: syco install-kvmhost
#command21: syco install-dhcp-server
#command22: syco install-guest install-sc
#command23: syco remote-install install-sc
#command24: syco install-guests
#command30: syco install-sssd
#command31: syco hardening-ssh</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre>[localhost.localdomain.] <strong>&lt;--- name syco will take the host name and i math run the commands</strong>
desc:My localhost virtual host
type: host <strong>&lt;-- its i host if this is guest then vhen you run setup guest it will be created</strong>
command01: syco iptables-setup<strong> &lt;-- first command to run and commands that dont need server to be up.</strong>
command02: syco hardening
command03: syco install-ntp-client
command04: syco install-mail-relay-client
#command05: syco install-clam
#command20: syco install-kvmhost <strong>&lt;--- commands start with 20 are host uniq commands tex kvmhost yuu dont want all you server to be kvm host. This would be uniq on every host tex ldap-server,ntp-server and so on</strong>
#command21: syco install-dhcp-server
#command22: syco install-guest install-sc
#command23: syco remote-install install-sc
#command24: syco install-guests
#command30: syco install-sssd <strong> &lt;--- the commands run now will install services that need the server to be up. Ore are waiting for servers to be up.</strong>
#command31: syco hardening-ssh</pre>
<p>So now I setup som syco will run the syco command 1-4 on my server so lets run it.</p>
<pre>[root@localhost bin]# ./syco.py install-local
 System Console 0.3.0
Verify the SYCO master password: 
 Install all commands defined in install.cfg for host localhost.localdomain.
 Command: su -c 'syco iptables-setup'
 Command: su -c 'syco hardening'
 Command: su -c 'syco install-ntp-client'
 Command: su -c 'syco install-mail-relay-client'
[root@localhost bin]#</pre>
<h2>3 FORK !!!</h2>
<p>And now you have the start of syco up and running. Now go to the syco github project and fork syco and start wrinting you own plugins.</p>
