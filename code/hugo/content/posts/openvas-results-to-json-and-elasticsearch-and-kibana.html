<p>I have some openvas scanners running but to use the scanners a need the results as json files. Then i can use my ELK stack to visualize and have dashboards over the results from the scan.</p>



<p>Before I used vulwisperer to export the result from openvas and to get them into elk. But from the latest release of openvas the support from vulwipspere is gone.</p>



<p>So i have created my own pyton script that reads the results from openvas scannings. Store the results as json files on the filesystem.<br>Then i uses a logstash to read the file and send the results to elasticsearch.</p>
