<p>Yee so it was a long time ago when I spend days playing counter strike 1.6. And now when i got some more power full servers and some time I was thinking of setting up a some counter-strike server for me and some friends so we can play.<br><br>I have a nice kubernetes cluster in my garage and a run all my stuff inside kubernetes so it was natural to make them into a kubernetes deploy.</p>



<p>If you feel for playing join us at <a href="http://games.robots.beer">http://games.robots.beer</a></p>



<p>If you dont here are the manifest for kubernetes </p>
