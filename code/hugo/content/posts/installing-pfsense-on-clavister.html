<p>After we change our server location and install some new servers and firewalls (Firewall now in centos with iptables) we got one Clavister over.</p>
<p>We needed a new firewall in our office but did not want to use the Clavister firewall software so we decided to see if we could get PfSense running on the hardware.</p>
<p>We open the Clvister up and made some hardware changes to it.<br />
Incresning the memeory from 512mb to 2g. And removing the 1g flash card and installing and 320g sata hard drive.</p>
<p>Then we could connect and monitor and an usb keybord the the old clavister and start trying to install.<br />
First I tried from installing form usb cdrom and usb drive. But I only got mounting problems.</p>
<p>So for sorting this I set up a close by computer and attaced the sata cdrom from that computer into the Clavister. (Clavister had only one power and i used that for the sata hardrive)</p>
<p>And now the installation of pfsense on the Clavister Firewall worked.</p>
<p>So at the moment PfSense is running and we are setting up the pfsens to work in our system.<br />
It always feel good to get old hardware back to life.</p>
